As of the time of this writing, the Template is designed to be run on 
JDK1.4.2 and Tomcat 5.5.9. 

You need to be sure and download and install the
Tomcat 5.5.9-Compat package as well (this will let you run Tomcat on a 1.4 JDK)

You will also want to make sure you have any database drivers you need in 
${CATALINA_HOME}/common/lib, set an environment variable:

CATALINA_OPTS="-DUNIQUE-ID=dev-yourusername -Dsystem.environment=DEV"

in your computer manager on Windows or .profile/.bash_profile on *nix.

You will also need Maven 1.0.2 installed, MAVEN_HOME properly set, and it is a 
good idea to put $MAVEN_HOME/bin in your classpath.

To create your Eclipse project settings, run "maven eclipse" from the root of your
new Template project folder.
